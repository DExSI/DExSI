About the Copyright Holders
===========================

AQR Capital Management began pandas development in 2008. Development was
led by Wes McKinney. AQR released the source under this license in 2009.
Wes is now an employee of Lambda Foundry, and remains the pandas project
lead.

The PyData Development Team is the collection of developers of the PyData
project. This includes all of the PyData sub-projects, including pandas. The
core team that coordinates development on GitHub can be found here:
http://github.com/pydata.

Full credits for pandas contributors can be found in the documentation.

Our Copyright Policy
====================

PyData uses a shared copyright model. Each contributor maintains copyright
over their contributions to PyData. However, it is important to note that
these contributions are typically only changes to the repositories. Thus,
the PyData source code, in its entirety, is not the copyright of any single
person or institution. Instead, it is the collective copyright of the
entire PyData Development Team. If individual contributors want to maintain
a record of what changes/contributions they have specific copyright on,
they should indicate their copyright in the commit message of the change
when they commit the change to one of the PyData repositories.

With this in mind, the following banner should be used in any source code
file to indicate the copyright and license terms:

This program is linked with and uses Microsoft Distributable Code,
copyrighted by Microsoft Corporation. The Microsoft Distributable Code
includes the following files:

msvcr90.dll
msvcp90.dll
msvcm90.dll

If you further distribute programs that include the Microsoft
Distributable Code, you must comply with the restrictions on
distribution specified by Microsoft. In particular, you must require
distributors and external end users to agree to terms that protect the
Microsoft Distributable Code at least as much as Microsoft's own
requirements for the Distributable Code. See Microsoft's documentation
(included in its developer tools and on its website at microsoft.com)
for specific details.

Redistribution of the Windows binary build of the Python interpreter
complies with this agreement, provided that you do not:

- alter any copyright, trademark or patent notice in Microsoft's
Distributable Code;

- use Microsoft's trademarks in your programs' names or in a way that
suggests your programs come from or are endorsed by Microsoft;

- distribute Microsoft's Distributable Code to run on a platform other
than Microsoft operating systems, run-time technologies or application
platforms; or

- include Microsoft Distributable Code in malicious, deceptive or
unlawful programs.

These restrictions apply only to the Microsoft Distributable Code as
defined above, not to Python itself or any programs running on the
Python interpreter. The redistribution of the Python interpreter and
libraries is governed by the Python Software License included with this
file, or by other licenses as marked.
